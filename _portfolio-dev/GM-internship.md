Transformation of the results of R&D's laser welding experiments into knowledge that can be leveraged through standardized work and supporting tools.

{% include gallery id="images_gallery" %}

The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly software tool to represent and display research results on battery welding. Purposes and motivations as follow:

<ul>
  <li>PD needs to have science-based and easy-to-use methods to set battery weld specifications.</li>
  <li>ME needs to have science-based and easy-to-use methods to determine (ultrasonic or laser) weldability, weld quality, and welding process optimization.</li>
  <li>The developed tool will be easy to use so that PD/ME can quickly run through different design or manufacturing scenarios to achieve sound product/process designs.</li>
</ul>
PD: Product Developer & ME: Mechanical Engineer
